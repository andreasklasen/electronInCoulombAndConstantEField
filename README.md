Just head to https://andreasklasen.github.io/electronInCoulombAndConstantEField/ 
and enjoy an animation showing a fixed proton and an electron circulating around 
it. The animation assumes a classic model for the electron motion and the electron
position. The position of the electron is determined by solving the newton equation 
of motion. Two bars are enabling the user to change the animation velocity and the
strength of a constant electric field. The strength of the electric field is
depicted by the quantity of grey arrows going through the whole screen.

The background of this animation is to give pupils in the 7th grade a first feeling
of the concept of atoms within an external electric field. If the electric field is
too strong, the electron is leaving the atom leading to free charged particles 
enforcing spontaneous discharging effects like in a lightning.
